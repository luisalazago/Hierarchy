Adolf Hitler] (20 April 1889 — 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician who was
the dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 until his suicide in 1945. He rose to power as the leader
of the Nazi Party,!*] becoming the chancellor in 1933 and then taking the title of Fuhrer und
Reichskanzier in 1934. His invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 marked the start of the
Second World War. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was
central to the perpetration of the Holocaust: the genocide of about six million Jews and millions off
other victims.

Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn in Austria-Hungary and was raised near Linz. He lived in
Vienna in the first decade of the 1900s before moving to Germany in 1913. He was decorated
during his service in the German Army in World War |, receiving the Iron Cross. In 1919, he
joined the German Workers’ Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and in 1921 was
appointed leader of the Nazi Party. In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed|
coup in Munich and was sentenced to five years in prison, serving just over a year of his
sentence. While there, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto
Mein Kampf (My Struggle). After his early release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by
attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-
communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced
communism as being part of an international Jewish conspiracy.
